## DSA 210 PROJECT AYŞEGÜL ÇELİKOK
## Motivation
As a final-year university student, balancing my professional responsibilities and entertainment time is crucial for me. I use Linkedin  as a platform for job search and networking on the other hand TikTok is a highly engaging but distracting entertainment app. With graduation approaching, my Linkedin usage is expected to increase as I actively look for job opportunities. At the same time, TikTok, known for its addictive short-form content, might act as a distraction, reducing the time I spend on my career via Linkedin.

By analyzing my screen time data over one year, I aim to:

Understand whether higher Linkedin usage correlates with reduced TikTok engagement, or vice versa and determining if one platform's increased usage directly affects the time spent on the other.

Identify daily trends—for example, whether TikTok usage peaks during breaks in the day, while Linkedin usage peaks during job application periods.

 
## Project Goal
The goal of this project is to analyze how my screen time on Linkedin and TikTok fluctuates throughout my final year. By tracking daily usage data, I will explore whether professional engagement on Linkedin and entertainment-driven TikTok usage influence each other. This project will enable me to understand how to better manage and spend my time thus to stay focused during the important job search period.

## Data Description
The dataset comprise daily screen time data for Linkedin and TikTok over one year and includes the following columns:

Date: The specific day of recorded screen time usage.

Linkedin_ScreenTime (minutes): The total time spent on Linkedin each day.

TikTok_ScreenTime (minutes): The total time spent on TikTok each day.

Total_ScreenTime (minutes): The sum of daily screen time across both platforms.

Day_Type: Categorizzation of ‘Weekday’ or ‘Weekend’ to analyze differences in usage patterns.

Academic_Events: Labels whether significant academic events occurred on that day like exam period etc.

## Data Analysis
## 1. Data Preprocessing
In this phase, the following steps will be taken to ensure the data is clean and ready for analysis:

•	Cleaning and structuring the daily screen time data for Linkedin and TikTok. This includes identifying inconsistencies or missing data.

•	Standardizing time units for consistency, such as controlling all data is in minutes per day.

•	Aligning timestamps to ensure Linkedin and TikTok data can be compared across different days, allowing us to identify trends in usage.

## 2. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
This phase will involve analyzing the overall trends in the usage of Linkedin and TikTok:

•	Identifying daily trends in screen time for both platforms to understand patterns in engagement.

•	Identifying peak usage days for each platform ( job application deadlines, after stressful academic events) and detecting whether TikTok usage increases during stressful academic periods or job search phases to understand if entertainment usage is linked to stress or high workload periods.

## 3. Correlation Analysis
This phase will investigate the relationship between Linkedin and TikTok usage:

•	Investigating whether increased Linkedin screen time correlates with decreased TikTok usage (or vice versa).
•	Identifying whether TikTok usage acts as a distraction during peak Linkedin usage periods (for example, during job search or internship application periods).

•	Calculating correlation coefficients to measure the strength and direction of the relationship between Linkedin and TikTok usage over time.

## 4. Visualization
To help visualize the trends and relationships, several types of charts will be created:

• Line charts comparing daily Linkedin and TikTok usage patterns to clearly show fluctuations across days.	

•	Bar charts that highlight peak usage days for each platform, providing a clear view of when each platform sees the highest engagement.

•	Scatter plots that analyze the impact of increased job search activity on entertainment-based screen time (i.e., whether a focus on Linkedin correlates with a drop in TikTok usage).

By analyzing these trends, the project aims to answer the central question: Does spending more time on Linkedin (for job searching) mean less time on TikTok, or do they coexist? 
## 5. Hypothesis Testing

•	Statistical tests will be used to validate the hypothesis that increased time spent on TikTok correlates with reduced Linkedin usage, and vice versa. We will test whether there is a significant relationship between them.

•	Additionally, we will test whether Linkedin usage increases during job search periods (with a focus on employment-related tasks) and whether TikTok engagement peaks during low-academic workload periods (e.g., breaks or periods without exams).
## 6. Conclusion
At the conclusion of this analysis:

•	A summary of findings will be provided and it will also discuss how balancing professional engagement with entertainment impacts productivity, stress levels, and overall time management, offering insights on how students and job-seekers can optimize their use of both platforms during critical phases of their academic and career journey.
